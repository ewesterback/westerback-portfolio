      'Battling imposter syndrome as a minority in STEM can be difficuly, especially when there is a significant lack of peers that look like you.  MentorUp! aims to create a place for minorities to connect and message with others within the software engineering field.

    briefDescription:
      'Studies show that playing Tetris can relieve stress and troubling thoughts by providing a form of distraction.  I had a lot of fun making (and testing!) my version of Tetris made with vanilla javascript and soothing and positive colors.  Figuring out how to rotate non-symmetrical pieces was rewarding, and I look forward to making this mobile compatible.',

Honeydew allows users to login to view their personalized to-do lists. They can add different lists and then add and/or delete todos for that list.  We completed this app in a group of 2 in a 24 hour hackathon.  I owned the backend and owned almost all of the dashboard and todos.`,
